		<h1>So you want to be a husky sailor?</h1>
		<p>It is a huge commitment to be a full member of the team. It means going to sailing practice multiple times a week. It means taking lots of 8:30 classes. It means studying in Mother Ode until 4am. It means spending almost every weekend at regattas. But it's worth it! Obviously, not everyone is down to do that, and we understand. If you are, great! If you aren't that doesn't mean you still can't sail with us!</p>
		<h2>How to join the team:</h2>
		<h3>Step 1:</h3><P>Decide when you can go to practice. We are currently not practcing right now, as most--but not all--of us don't want to lose our fingers. Check back here later.</P>
		<h3>Step 2:</h3><p>Tell us who you are, how much you've sailed <a href="#">(it's totally okay if you haven't)</a>, and when you want to sail with us. You can do that <a href="/joinus/newsailor/">here.</a></p>
		<h3>Step 3:</h3><p>Show Up! We practice at <a href="https://sailsandpoint.org">Sail Sand Point.</a> That's a ways from campus, so we have <a href="#">directions here.</a></p>
