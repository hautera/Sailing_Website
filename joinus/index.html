			<h1>So you want to be a husky sailor?</h1>
			<p>It is a huge commitment to be a full member of the team. It means going to sailing practice three to four times a week. It means spending almost every weekend at regattas. It means traveling around Washington, Oregon and California to get to the regattas. But it's worth it! Obviously, not everyone is down to do that, and we understand. If you are, great! If you aren’t, that doesn't mean you still can't sail with us! As a team, we are all-inclusive. The only requirement to sail with us is a willingness to sail and get better. Many members of the team had no previous sailing experience when they joined. Some members have been sailing since they could walk. Don’t feel like your experience or lack thereof will disqualify you from participating. It won’t! Sailing is great. We hope you come out and try it!</p>
			<h2>How to join the team:</h2>
			<h3>Step 1:</h3><P>Decide when you can go to practice. We practice every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday from 2:30pm till dark.</P>
			<h3>Step 2:</h3><p>Tell us who you are, how much you've sailed (it's totally okay if you haven't), and when you want to sail with us. You can do that <a href="/uwsails/joinus/newsailor/">here.</a></p>
			<h3>Step 3:</h3><p>Show Up! We practice at <a href="https://sailsandpoint.org">Sail Sand Point.</a> That's a ways from campus, so we have <a href="#">directions here.</a></p>
