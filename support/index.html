			<h1>Thank you for your support!</h1>
			<h2>There are a lot of ways to help us:</h2>
			<h3>Team Auction:</h3>
			<p>The team auction is our primary means of raising money. It will be held <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/week/2018/2/23"><u><b>Feburary 23rd, 2018</u>. Save the date!! </b></a>It will be held in the <a href ="http://depts.washington.edu/ecc/">ECC building</a> on campus. Directions are <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Samuel+E.+Kelly+Ethnic+Cultural+Center/@47.6552222,-122.3135293,16z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sECC!3m4!1s0x549014f249fb3b57:0x65ddba01328d0f69!8m2!3d47.655095!4d-122.314784">here</a>. There will be food, cool stuff to buy, and awesome sailors to talk to! Please be there to support us!</p>
			<h3>Donate Money:</h3>
			<p>We are in desperate need of money. We use the money donated to travel to regattas, pay for boats, and maintain the boats we use. This helps open up the team to everyone regardless of how much money they have. We are able to send good sailors to awesome places because of the donations. Any amount of money that can be donated is greatly appreciated! Venmo @UW-Sailing money and say it's a donation.</p>
			<h3>Get the word out:</h3><p>The more people who know about us the better! That could mean more sailors, more donors, and more Friends of Husky Sailing! If you know anyone who likes sailing, and would be interested in what we're doing, share this website with them!</p>
