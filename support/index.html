			<p>The University of Washington Sailing Team is a self-supported club sport comprised of undergraduate students at the University of Washington. We are largely mentored and supported by alumni and other members of the Northwest sailing community. If you would like to see the team continue to grow and compete in sailing events, you can make an online, tax deductible donation through the University of Washington Development Fund for the Sailing Team at <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/ima/club-sports/development-fund/">https://www.washington.edu/ima/club-sports/development-fund/</a> or mail a donation to: </br>UW Sailing Team</br>PO Box 354090</br>Seattle, Washington 98195</p>
			<h3>Get the word out:</h3><p>The more people who know about us the better! That could mean more sailors, more donors, and more Friends of Husky Sailing! If you know anyone who likes sailing, and would be interested in what we're doing, share this website with them!</p>
