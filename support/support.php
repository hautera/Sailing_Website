You get good food and we get $$$$$$$, it's a win-win!</p>
	<h3>Donate Money:</h3>
	<p>We are in desperate need of money.
	We use the money donated to travel to regattas, pay for boats, and maintain the boats we use. This helps open up the team to everyone regardless of how much money they have. We are able to send good sailors to awesome places because of the donations. Any amount of money that can be donated is greatly appreciated! Venmo @UW-Sailing money and say it's a donation.</p>
	<h3>Get the word out:</h3><p>The more people who know about us the better! That could mean more sailors, more donors, and more Friends of Husky Sailing! If you know anyone who likes sailing, and would be interested in what we're doing, share this website with them!</p>
