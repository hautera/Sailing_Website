		  <p>The University of Washington sailing team is a student-lead competitive sailing team. We primarily race in cFJs, but we also sail compete in lasers and J22s. We are a club sport representing the University of Washington in the Inter-collegiate Sailing Association. Our  women’s and co-ed teams are top-ranked in our division—the Northwest Inter-collegiate Sailing Association (NWISCA). The team practices at Sail Sand Point on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. We have around 20 active members, but we’re always looking for more.
